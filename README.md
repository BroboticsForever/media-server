# README for Server Template scripts
This repository is designed to be a scafolding for development of a NodeJS server, though it can really be adapted to work for any server. It's purpose is to provide a method of easily starting and stopping your server without always having to remember the commands to run the server, and to keep track of the PID it is running on for you.
